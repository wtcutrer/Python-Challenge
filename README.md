HW3 - Pye Me Up Charlie 

## Breakdown
In this Assignment, a Python script was created in order to analyze two different csv's. The two csv's contained banking and voting data that was provided by the instructor. Both of these challenges encompass real-world situations that programmers face everyday. The folders for each challenge contain the script used, a resource folder that contains the csv, and an analysis folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis. Instructions for this assignment are provided below.

## Instructions
In this homework assignment, concepts learned through the course were used to complete two Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. The final script for both challenges should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### Pybank 
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
